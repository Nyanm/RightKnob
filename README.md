# Right Knob

An SDVX music searcher for Android.

Just enter anything related to the song you want to search, the name, the artist, the memes. 
You can contribute to this project by a meme pull request to enrich the searching database or give the developer advice on coding.

## Mechanism

Right Knob captures the user input and searches it in a build-in SQLite database which stores music information of Sound Voltex.

Theoretically, codes here are only for exhibition and study use. 
Because of some copyright issues we all know, most resource files could not be uploaded. 

## Release 

Latest release will be published at [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/nyanm/apps/right-knob/distribution_groups/user).

## Trivia

The most direct way to support the developer is by sending me the latest version of [BUY SOME APPLES] so that I can update the music database to catch the official game version XD
